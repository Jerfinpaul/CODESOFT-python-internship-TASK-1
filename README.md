This is a simple To-Do List application built using Python. The app allows users to add, view, and delete tasks from a list. It's designed to demonstrate basic Python concepts like file handling, functions, and basic user interface in the console.

Features
Add Task: Allows the user to add a new task to the to-do list.
View Tasks: Displays all the tasks currently in the list.
Delete Task: Allows the user to delete a task by its number from the list.
Persistent Data Storage: The tasks are saved in a text file so they persist across program runs.
